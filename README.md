# Mercap

To run a live test of the code:

* Install `node version 16.13.0`.
* Access `src` folder.
* Run: `node main.js`

### Assumptions:

For the resolution of this challenge I assumed:

* Long distance calls have a fixed cost per minute according to the location.
* Countries and Calls modeling exceeds the resolution. The only part modelated was the one related to costs.
